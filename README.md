# Drive Copier
Jacob Burton 1/11/2023

Personal Project for a console application which can copy one drive to a new drive.
This is a prototype and currently can list drive information such as: Letter, Type, Total Size (in MB), and Free Space (in MB), display all files and folders on a drive, and copy all files and folders to a different drive.

There is simple error checking to not allow a user to fit a larger set of data onto a drive of a smaller size. System files are disallowed from being moved or copied.

As a note: I am researching and learning as I am programming this application.
